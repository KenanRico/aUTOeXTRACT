## Usage

- Your input should be: a zip file of any of the supported types (listed below) that is located within a directory. Note that this zip file should be the only file in the directory. Please refer to _Test_ in this repo.
- Run the script name `recursive_extract.py`.
	- With Unix bash shell: `python recursive_extract`
	- With Windows, run the script with python interpreter UI. E.g. open script with IDLE and select "run module"
- Be fully certain you are running the script for the correct target directory, as the script will pick up all archives in that directory.
- All extracted files can be located in _<target dir>/<Extract>_ folder when script finishes.
